# Convex-Hull-project
Coursework focusing on implementations of the Covex Hull algorithm to find the perimeter of a set of points. Includes implementation of both Complex Hull and Divide & Conquer Convex Hull. All are implemented in MATLAB.

## Tests completed using the implementations of Convex Hull
### Basic Convex Hull Problem Test

### Handelling start position A, 2 destinations B and C and multiple polygons

A test was also completed comparing my implementation against the MATLAB's own convhull() function which have the same results.
